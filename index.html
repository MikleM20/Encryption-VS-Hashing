            <h1>What is this Site?</h1>
            This is a website that discusses encryption, cryptographic hashing and the comparison between the two.
            It is suggested that if you do not know the basics of these two you first go to the hash or encryption page
            using the links in the top right.

			<h1>What is Encryption?</h1>
            Encryption is the <strong>TWO-WAY</strong>process of scambling information in a way such that it can
            be unscambled/decrypted by someone else using a key. <br><br>

            To encrypt data people use a cipher, which is pretty much another way of saying algorithm; a list of
            steps and rules to follow. Knowing how this cipher works is usually the key required to decrypt a piece
            of encrypted data.

			<h1>How does it Work?</h1>
            As said about a cipher/algorithm is used to encrypt and decrypt data. Many types of algorithms exist to encrypt data. Here are some
            easy to visualize examples.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shift Cipher: </strong>Probably the simplest example, this cipher simply shifts the alphabet by a fixed amount.</li>
            </ul>
            <img id = "comic" src = "./media/comic2.png" alt = "Alphabet Shift Representation">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Substitution Cipher: </strong>Using this cipher, plaintext characters are replaced systematically, a faily simple
                example of this type of cipher is ROT13, which places the english alphabet of 26 characters into 2 arrays of 13, a-m and n-z.
                Using these 2 arrays, you replace a character with the index from one array with the character at the same index in the opposite array.
                An example would be replacing all 'A's with 'N's and vice versa as they are both at the index 0 of the 2 opposing arrays. </li>
            
                <li><strong>Transposition Cipher: </strong>This algorithm uses a set of rules, which serve as the key to encrypt data. One example
                of this type of cipher is the <strong>Rail Fence Cipher</strong>, which places the plaintext in a graph with n "tracks"/"rails" in a zig-zagonal 
                pattern then using creating the output from what is in the "rails".<br>Here is a representation of encrypting the alphabet with 4 tracks.
                As you can see AGMSY is from track 1, then tracks 2, 3, and 4 follow respectively.</li>
            </ul>

			<h1>Example Of When It Would be Helpful</h1>
			Imagine you are sending or recieving data online, if that data is valuable you would most likely want to encrypt the data 
            so that the information you are sending is more secure. However, since you must also send the recipient the key, if the attacker gets access to both
            the data and key, it is possible that they can decrypt the data.
